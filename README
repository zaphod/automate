The gem comes with the following files
db tasks
nmap - nukes migrates and prepares database for build 
validation - validates data against the ruby object model - checks db constraints and prints a report with invalid data - uses
rails model validations
constraints - enforces constraints on the database

mysql
controls the mysql instance
shutdown the instance, grant permissions, create users, create schemas, 
drop databases, drop users

performance 
generates random data to populate database for performance testing
httperf - performance httperf based test and analysis for gauging performance

rake commit


builds
dev - build, ci(continuous integration), pc(pre commit), commit, test:unit, test:functionals 
test, qa - setup qa environment with qa, test data and run tests
selenium - run selenium tests with selenium grid or without
selenium_grid
smoke - run smoke tests - picked by the team
html:validation - validates html using tidy

routes - shows routes in the app
clean - cleans tmp directory of logs, sessions etc.

coverage  - rcov - test coverage for ruby

Build.rake
Build tasks for the project - includes triggering builds with a preset sequence of tasks
eg: 
build:acceptance:firefox does the following
* sets up the environment
* sets up environment specific for acceptance tests
* clears tmp directory
* nukes, migrates and prepares database
* fills the database with sample_data for acceptance tests
* runs tests

Routes.rake
Pretty prints all the routes in your project

svn.rake
Makes all the svn related tasks rakeable. 

test.rake
Has all tasks to run tests

db tasks
* Resets database
* Takes a snapshot of the database (so you can examine the database at the time of test failures, restart from a known point)
* Checks for violations of table constraints
* controls the mysql instance through rake


build.rake
clean_all.rake
growl.rake
